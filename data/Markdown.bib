	title = {Thought {Experiments}},
	url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entrieshought-experiment/},
	abstract = {Thought experiments are devices of the imagination used to investigatethe nature of things. They are used for diverse reasons in a varietyof areas, including economics, history, mathematics, philosophy, andthe sciences, especially physics. Most often thought experiments arecommunicated in narrative form, frequently with diagrams. Thoughtexperiments should be distinguished from thinking about experiments,from merely imagining any experiments to be conducted outside theimagination, and from psychological experiments with thoughts. Theyshould also be distinguished from counterfactual reasoning in general,as they seem to require an experimental element, which seems toexplain the impression that something is experienced in a thoughtexperiment. In other words, though many call any counter-factual orhypothetical situation a thought experiment, this seems tooencompassing. It seems right to demand that they also be visualized(or perhaps smelled, tasted, heard, touched); there should besomething experimental about a thought experiment. , The primary philosophical challenge of thought experiments is simple:How can we learn about reality (if we can at all), just by thinking?More precisely, are there thought experiments that enable us toacquire new knowledge about the intended realm of investigationwithout new empirical data? If so, where does the new information come from ifnot from contact with the realm of investigation underconsideration? Finally, how can we distinguish good from bad instancesof thought experiments? These questions seem urgent with respectto scientific thought experiments, because most philosophers andhistorians of science “recognize them as an occasionally potenttool for increasing our understanding of nature. […]Historically their role is very close to the double one played byactual laboratory experiments and observations. First, thoughtexperiments can disclose nature's failure to conform to a previouslyheld set of expectations. Second, they can suggest particularways in which both expectation and theory must henceforth berevised.” (Kuhn, 1977, p. 241 and 261) The questions are urgentregarding philosophical thought experiments, because they play animportant role in philosophical discourse. Philosophy without thoughtexperiments seems almost hopeless., There is widespread agreement that thought experiments play acentral role both in philosophy and in the natural sciences. Generalacceptance of the importance of some of the well-known thoughtexperiments in the natural sciences, like Maxwell's demon, Einstein'selevator or Schrödinger's cat. Probably more often than not,these, and many other thought experiments have led the carefulanalysis of their epistemic powers to the conclusion that we shouldnot portray science as an exclusively empirical activity (seeWinchester, 1990, p. 79)., The 17th century saw some of its most brilliant practitioners inGalileo, Descartes, Newton, and Leibniz. And in our own time, thecreation of quantum mechanics and relativity are almost unthinkablewithout the crucial role played by thought experiments. Much ofethics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind is based on theresults of thought experiments as well, including Searle's Chineseroom, Putnam's twin earth, and Jackson's Mary the colourscientist. Philosophy, even more than the sciences, would be severelyimpoverished without thought experiments, which suggests that aunified theory of thought experiments is desirable to account for themin both the sciences and the humanities (see Boniolo, 1997; Cooper,2005, pp. 329–330; Gähde, 2000). That is to say: since thesciences, especially physics, and philosophy both make use of thoughtexperiments, then, other things being equal, a unified account seemsdesirable., There have been attempts to define “thoughtexperiment”, but likely it will be better to leave the termloosely characterized, so as not to prejudice the ongoinginvestigation. Of course, we need to have some idea as to what thoughtexperiments are to guide a proper philosophical analysis (seeHaggqvist, 2009), but this does not mean we need to begin with atechnical definition, specifying necessary and sufficientconditions. In fact, many of the most important concepts we deal withremain rather loosely defined when philosophical inquiry begins, e.g.,religion or democracy. Luckily, there are plenty of examples to referto in order to circumscribe our subject matter well enough. As well asthose already mentioned, there are Newton's bucket, Heisenberg'sgamma-ray microscope, Einstein's elevator, Leibniz's mill, Parfit'speople who split like amoebas, and Thomson's violinist. Everyone isprobably familiar with some of these. Less familiar thoughtexperiments include “the dome”, a relatively new thoughtexperiment and probably the simplest example of indeterminism inNewtonian physics. Imagine a mass sitting on a radially symmetricsurface in a gravitational field. Guided by Newton's laws of motionone comes to realize that the mass can either remain at rest for alltimes, or spontaneously move in an arbitrary direction (see Norton,2008). This thought experiment triggers a number of very interestingquestions concerning the nature of Newtonian theory, the meaning of“physical”, and the role of idealizations in physics. And,of course, does it show what it claims? , In the following we will first highlight some of the most commonfeatures of thought experiments. A proposal follows for classifyingthought experiments, before reviewing the state of the debate onthought experimenting, preceded by some remarks about the history ofphilosophical inquiry into thought experiments. We conclude byhighlighting some of the recent developments surrounding the so-calledlaboratory of the mind.},

	abstract = {Although knowledge representation is one of the central and, in some ways, most familiar concepts in AI, the most fundamental question about it – What is it? – has rarely been answered directly. Numerous papers have lobbied for one or another variety of representation, other papers have argued for various properties a representation should have, and still others have focused on properties that are important to the notion of representation in general. In this article, we go back to basics to address the question directly. We believe that the answer can best be understood in terms of five important and distinctly different roles that a representation plays, each of which places different and, at times, conflicting demands on the properties a representation should have. We argue that keeping in mind all five of these roles provides a usefully broad perspective that sheds light on some longstanding disputes and can invigorate both research and practice in the field.},

	abstract = {Science makes extensive use of models, i.e. simplified or idealized representations of the systems found in the physical world. Models fall into at least two categories: mathematical and physical models. In this paper, we focus attention mainly on the latter, trying to show that they are essential tools not only of the scientific description of the world 'out there', but of man's cognition of things, especially things not directly accessible to the senses. The spring-and-ball (SB) model of chemistry is a most instructive example of a physical model. In other disciplines, from cosmology to physiology, models are used that are of the same kind or play the same role. It is concluded that physical models are objects which belong to the world accessible to man's direct experience, often constructed ad hoc and possibly idealized. They serve as referents for analogies, which appear to be indispensable in most aspects of scientific theorizing, especially for the understanding of the submicroscopic levels of reality.},

Reasoning as performed by human beingstypically involves information obtained through more than one medium.Formal logic, by contrast, has thus far been primarily concerned withvalid reasoning which is based on information in one form only, i.e., inthe form of sentences. Recently, many philosophers, psychologists,logicians, mathematicians, and computer scientists have becomeincreasingly aware of the importance of multi-modal reasoning and,moreover, much research has been undertaken in the area ofnon-symbolic, especially diagrammatic, representation systems. Thisentry outlines the overall directions of this new research area andfocuses on the logical status of diagrams in proofs, theirrepresentational function and adequacy, different kinds of diagrammaticsystems, and the role of diagrams in human cognition.},
