This was the homework:

GISting the “Dispatch” II: Mapping geographical data from the “Dispatch”
¦ Extract toponyms (place names) from the “Dispatch” (python)
¦ Calculate their frequencies (python)
¦ Add coordinates to those places (QGIS/python)
? Hint : you can create two lists 1) one with place names and their
frequencies, 2) with place names and their coordinates; after that, you can
merge them with python and generate a CSV file (placename, latitude,
longitude, frequency) which can be used for creating a map in QGIS
¦ Map them in QGIS, using frequencies to size the markers on the map
? Describe the process in a blogpost and publish on your website
