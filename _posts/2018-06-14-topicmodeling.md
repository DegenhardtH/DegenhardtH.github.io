title: Topic Modeling with R

---


As I told you already in the course, I had some problems getting the results I wished for with the provided code.
I looked at every single line for defaults, but could not find one.
Maybe my computer has not enough working space, but as far as I know my colleagues had the same problems.

The problem was that as soon as I ran the R-script on the 'dispatch' without a limitation of articles, it composed only plain statistics.
When I ran it with a limitation of articles it looked into, there where no such problems.
Therefore I will post all four pictures per process: the two with no limitation of articles, and the two with a limitation of articles.
But I only can analyze those pictures with a limitation of articles.

1:
those with no limitation:
![topicmodeling1ba] (/img/dendrogram_of_topics_1b.png)
![topicmodeling1bb] (/img/tm20_A20_50_iter500_Max10_Topic_1b.png)

Those with limitation of articles:
![topicmodeling1aa] (/img/dendrogram_of_topics_1a.png)
![topicmodeling1ab] (/img/tm20_A20_50_iter500_Max10_Topic_1a.png)

2:
Those with no limitation:
![topicmodeling1ca] (/img/dendrogram_of_topics2b.png)
![topicmodeling1cb] (/img/tm50_A20_50_iter500_Max10_Topic_2b.png)


Those with limitation of articles:
![topicmodeling1aa] (/img/dendrogram_of_topics_2a.png)
![topicmodeling1ab] (/img/tm50_A20_50_iter500_Max10_Topic_2a.png)
